Homework 4

There are three classes, Ducking, Standing, Jumping.
There is one interface, it contains the various actions that 
Mario can take. Each action may or may not result in a state
change. Mario is itself a singleton. And in each state class,
th state itself should be a singleton. This allows the states
to change dynamically.

The Ducking class:
duck{Do nothing}
move{Do nothing}
stand{Change state to Standing}
jump{Do Nothing}

The Standing class:
duck{Duck}
move{Move left or right, no state change}
stand{Do nothing}
jump{Change state to Jumping}

The Jumping class:
duck{Dive, no state change}
move{Do nothing}
stand{Do nothing}
jump{Do Nothing}
